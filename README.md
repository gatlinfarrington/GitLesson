**This Project Serves as an introduction to Git for the students on FIRST Robotics teams**

- The first step is for each student to clone the repo. This ensures that they have a github account and git installed on their computer
- The second step is for them to make a request to a [.NET 6 minimal API that I run locally on a desktop at home](https://github.com/gatlinfarrington/GitLessonAPI), exposed through [ngrok](https://ngrok.com)
- The API will serve each student JSON instructions, there are 4 sets of instructions, each slightly different
- Students are asked to make their own brances of the repository, make specific changes, and open Pull Requests back to the working branch
- Students, depending on which instruction set they were assigned, will either have no issues while merging, or be faced with Merge Conflicts that they must resolve.
